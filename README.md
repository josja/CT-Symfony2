### Todo Notes
===

A Symfony project created on April 8, 2016, 12:35 pm.

Todo is a TodoMVC built from scratch as a coding task for Buro Blauw Geel.

Approached it pragmatically by create a Symfony v2.8 project and add the TodoType. The newer Symfony version
caught me off guard, like it doesn't come preconfigured with Assetic. Diving in to Angular this
is actually a bonus (Angular doesn't like Assetic either).

Next step is fine tuning the functionality and looks.

Last step could be to make it a RESTFull API and create a simple AngularJS front end using the API.
