### Symfony2 Code Task: Todo Notes
===
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/josja/CT-ReaktJS.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/josja/notes)

A Symfony project created on April 8, 2016, 12:35 pm.

Todo is a MVC application built as a coding task for a company in Utrecht.

Approached it pragmatically by creating a Symfony v2.8 project and add the Todo entity. The newer Symfony version
caught me sometimes off guard, like it doesn't come preconfigured with Assetic. Diving into Angular this
is actually a bonus (Angular doesn't like Assetic either).

Tests cover 82.61% of functions & methods. Added Travis config to show pretty badge. Travis was on my bucket list
a long time, finally a reason to start using it.

Last step could be to add a RESTFull API and create a simple AngularJS frontend.
