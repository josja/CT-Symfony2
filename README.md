### Todo Notes
===

A Symfony project created on April 8, 2016, 12:35 pm.

Todo is a MVC application built as a coding task for Buro Blauw Geel.

Approached it pragmatically by creating a Symfony v2.8 project and add the Todo entity. The newer Symfony version
caught me sometimes off guard, like it doesn't come preconfigured with Assetic. Diving into Angular this
is actually a bonus (Angular doesn't like Assetic either).

Current step is to fine tune the functionality and looks.

Last step could be to add a RESTFull API and create a simple AngularJS frontend.
